/**
 * A form as a machine, sent over a flaky wire. Typing folds into the context and validation
 * is a pure reading of it. `submit` is a guard cascade: whole, the form goes to `sending`;
 * not whole, the same event stays in `editing` and marks every field. The send is a phase:
 * where there is no `input` rule the form is locked without a single flag.
 *
 * Every send carries the attempt's number — its ticket — and the answer brings the ticket
 * back. `fail` is a second cascade: the last allowed attempt gives the form up, an earlier
 * one is a refusal with a retry, and an answer whose ticket is not the one in flight matches
 * no rule at all — a duplicate or a straggler is dropped, and `dispatch` says so with `false`.
 *
 *   editing ── submit·whole ─▸ sending ── ok·mine ──▸ sent
 *   sending ── fail·mine ───▸ refused ── retry ────▸ sending (ticket advanced)
 *   sending ── fail·spent ──▸ failed
 *   refused, failed ── input ─▸ editing (the budget starts over)
