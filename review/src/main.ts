/**
 * The page: a queue of one submission, and the buttons that move it.
 *
 * Three things are worth watching for while reading this file, because all three are the point.
 *
 * The first is that no handler tests the phase. A button is enabled by asking the machine
 * `can(event)` — the same question the next `dispatch` would answer — so the set of things you may
 * do right now is held by the schema and read off it, never mirrored here. Delete a rule from the
 * table and the button goes grey; add one and it lights up. The question narrows by payload too:
 * once anna has signed, `can("sign", { who: "anna", … })` is false while the same question about
 * boris is still true, and the buttons diverge without any code about signers.
 *
 * The second is the wait. `submit` emits `gate`, this file runs the checks and dispatches
 * `checked` back, and in between the machine sits in `checking` — a phase, with no `write` rule in
 * it, which is what makes the document uneditable while CI has it. The waiting is in the machine.
 * Nothing here holds a promise, a flag, or a boolean called `busy`.
 *
 * The signature is real: ECDSA P-256 over the document text, computed here before the event is
 * dispatched — WebCrypto is asynchronous and the machine is not, so the signing happens in the
 * handler and the machine receives a finished signature.
