/**
 * The machine — sections 4 and 5 of the example write-up.
 *
 * The schema comes first, because the schema *is* the description of the
 * machine; everything below it is the bodies of the functions the schema names.
 * The file reads top to bottom exactly once: which transitions exist, then how
 * each one is computed.
 *
 * That order is possible because the guards and the operations are declared
 * with `function`, and function declarations hoist. Written as `const` arrows
 * they would be reached before initialisation and throw on the TDZ.
 *
 * `with` builds the context of the phase being *entered*, which is why entering
 * `empty` takes none at all and entering a drag cannot forget what a drag
 * remembers. The word does not mean "update the context" but "the context to
 * arrive with", and the phase named by `to` decides its shape.
